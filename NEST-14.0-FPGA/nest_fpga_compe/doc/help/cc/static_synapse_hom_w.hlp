Name: static_synapse_hom_w - Synapse type for static connections with 
 homogeneous weight.

Description:

static_synapse_hom_w does not support any kind of plasticity. It simply 
stores the parameters delay, target, and receiver port for each connection 
and uses a common weight for all connections.


Parameters:

No Parameters


Transmits:

SpikeEvent, RateEvent, CurrentEvent, ConductanceEvent, 
DataLoggingRequest, DoubleDataEvent


Remarks:

The common weight for all connections of this model must be set by 
SetDefaults on the model. If you create copies of this model using 
CopyModel, each derived model can have a different weight.
